# Codsoft Quiz Project

This project is a fully interactive **Quiz Application** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application features a quiz interface that allows users to engage with multiple questions, track their scores, and view results in real-time. It has been designed to provide a smooth user experience with a structured flow from quiz initiation to result display.

## Features:

- **User Interface**: A clean and interactive design that guides the user through the quiz process, including start, quiz section, and results.
- **Score Tracking**: The user's score is updated in real-time, and feedback is provided after each question.
- **Progress Display**: The current question number and total questions are displayed to give users an idea of their progress through the quiz.
- **Result Section**: At the end of the quiz, a result box shows the user's total score, with a progress indicator (circular progress bar) to visually represent the percentage score.
- **Try Again Functionality**: Users can restart the quiz with the "Try Again" button, resetting the quiz data for a fresh attempt.
- **Home Button**: Allows users to exit the quiz and return to the main screen.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: For the structure of the quiz application.
- **CSS**: For styling the quiz interface, including buttons, progress bars, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For the quiz logic, question handling, score calculation, and dynamic updates.

## Key Components:

- **Quiz Flow Control**: Users can start the quiz, answer questions, and see results seamlessly, with buttons like **Start**, **Next**, **Try Again**, and **Go Home** managing the quiz flow.
